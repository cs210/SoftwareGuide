By radically simplifying the language, creating time travel debugging interfaces, and exposing inline type annotations and values, the editor reports feedback on errors quickly, enabling rapid iteration. Goals include a live profiler that displays hot paths while coding and a logger to visualize runtime values with the statically determined WASM stack. \n\nThe final application of this editor will be a Stanford introductory course to computer science and signals processing, taking advantage of WASM's simplicity and performance to create an interactive learning environment.",
